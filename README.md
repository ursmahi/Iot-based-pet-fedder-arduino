# Iot-based-pet-fedder-arduino

  The main aim of the project is to get knowledge of Internet of Things and developing simple projects which are useful in our daily life activities. Here, we are willing to construct an entity where it provides food to the pet accordingly which can be controlled by the owner of the pet. This project provides the owner to feed their pet from anywhere by simply connecting mobile or pc to internet.	

  Nowadays most of us are fascinated to have pets at their home. But these pets have to be taken care properly. Their feeding on time is an important task as they become part of our family. But in our busy schedule we fail to pay attention on our pet thus it doesn’t get proper food on time. Pet Feeding System consists food storage, servo motor, feeding bowl, etc. It also features Arduino to control the operations using internet from anywhere. It is also possible to make more hi-tech by adding cameras and audio box to check activities of pet and talk to it. Pet feeding system features a machine which can feed pets (e.g. dogs) in absence of his master. By using machine master don’t have to stay with his pet every time to feed it and he gets liberty to do his other works outside without caring about his pet.
